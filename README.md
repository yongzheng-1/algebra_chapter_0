This is a solution manual for Paolo Aluffi's **ALGEBRA, Chapter 0**, a textbook that introduces abstract algebra using the language of categories. 
I find this approach to be particularly appealing. So I'm enthusiastic to share my solutions to the exercises in this book for others to reference.

As a beginner, I'm trying to make my proof explict and detailed, but unfortunately it seems verbose and tedious sometimes. 
Anyway, I would appreciate it if you can point out my mistakes, big or small.
